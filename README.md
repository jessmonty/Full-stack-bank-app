# Full-stack-bank-app
The purpose of this project was to learn how to extend a front-end banking application to have a back-end making it a full-stack banking application. This application uses Express, MongoDB, React, and NodeJS. 
Users can create an account in this application as well as login, make deposits and withdrawals with updated balances, and see all user data. It will also include authentication and authorization of users. The tabs on the navigation bar will only include Create Account, Login, and Home until the user logs in and then the tabs to deposit, withdraw will appear once logged in.
